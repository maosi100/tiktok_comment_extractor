## Technical Details

### Permissions

The extension requires the following permissions:

- `storage`: For storing configuration data
- `identity`: For authentication purposes
- `webRequest`: To intercept TikTok API calls

### API Limits

- Request delay: 1 second between comment batches
- Reply request delay: 1.5 seconds between reply batches

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No TikTok comment API URL captured" Error**

   - Make sure you're logged into TikTok
   - Try scrolling down on the video page to load comments
   - Refresh the page and try again

2. **Extension Button Not Appearing**

   - Check if the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
   - Make sure you're on a TikTok video page
   - Try refreshing the page

3. **Extraction Stops Prematurely**

   - This may happen due to API rate limits
   - Try again after a few minutes

   - Check the browser console for error messages
   - Verify you're on a valid TikTok video page
